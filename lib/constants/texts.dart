  static const dayOneQ_6 =
      '6.“When writing a song try to WRITE WHAT YOU KNOW!” (*Tip: maybe do not write about an astrophysicist if you are a professional baseball player - write about baseball! Later, when you have some songs written and on iTunes or Spotify you can try writing a song that is really different or far out there. Let’s stay in our swim lane for now.”';
  static const dayOneQ_7 =
      '7.“Try to think about a desirable tempo (speed) of your song as well as a tone (*or the “feel”) of the song.”';

  static const dayTwoQ_1 =
      '1.“Please jot down a first line for your song. Do not over think this step - just go for it.

  static const dayTwoQ_3 =
      '3.“Now try to LOOSELY OUTLINE your song. Just jot down 3 ideas that could make for a loose rough draft story of your song’s main character. Try to add a lot of details, some you will toss by the end. These notes can be minimal for now. They will hopefully give you enough material to eventually have 3 verses by the end of the week.”';

  static const dayThreeQ_2 =
      '2.“When writing a song, try to use all your SENSES. Songs often twist and turn like rivers follow. Ideas can come in through your touch, eyes, nose, mouth, and imagination. Think about all your senses when thinking about your song. Now commit to 3 senses, like smell, taste and sight that you want to explore in your song and give an example of each that you will use in your rough draft. This will change by the end, so do not over think this step.”';
  static const dayThreeQ_3 =
      '3.“Let your imagination be fueled by these multiple choice drop down boxes about YOUR SONG’S CHORUS. Will it have a sad, happy, content, confused, excited, exhausted, humored, angered feel?

  static const dayThreeQ_4 =
      '4.“Try to decide on a rough draft RHYMING SCHEME, with some temporary words at the end of each phrase that attempt to rhyme with the line before it or the line before that. Do not over think this. These lyrics will change many times this week, trust me.”';

  static const dayFourQ_2 =
      '2.“What 4 or 5 chords sound best together? Maybe only use 3 basic chords if you truly a beginner. Plenty of songs only use G,D, & C (as an example.) While playing these, have you been attempting to determine the rhythm for your song? You can state that idea here. We can guide you as you try different rhythms with these basic 3,4, or 5 chords.

Take a few lyrics and hum or strum a couple chords from your favorite 4 or 5 basic chord progressions. See what melody might match well with your favorite strumming pattern and chord progression. If you a beginner, one strum at a time is fine for choosing a melody to go with it. Slower tempo might be easier for you.”';
  static const dayFourQ_6 =
      '6.“Now that is is officially day 4 into your song writing career, you have TRULY gotten closer to knowing how this song will sound. Is your rhythm strumming pattern easy to follow like so many found on the internet? We can tell you that an easy and popular one is *D,D,U,U,D,U. This means strum: down, down, up, up, down, up. There are no rules about patterns for rhythm but consult the internet for 10 million “strumming pattern options” from 10 millions songs that have been HITS.”';
  static const dayFourQ_7 =
      '7.Fill in the blank for what chord progressions you are using for each of your 3 verses. For now let’s keep the verses all sounding alike. On your next song, you can try being creative and leaning into some small changes in chords in the verses.';

  static const dayFiveQ_1 =
      '1.“Songwriters, We need to create our chorus today on day 5 - let’s do this.

Do you love your rough draft song as sit is now? What can change over night? It is SO easy to change small parts of the song or move them around. Maybe your 1st verse is a better 3rd verse and you should end your song with it rather than start your song with it.”';
  static const dayFiveQ_2 =
      '2.“What is your favorite part about your song? Take that and run with it for the rest of your song writing! Try to replicate that again in other areas. If you love one line, repeat it elsewhere. Why not? There are no rules here.”';

  static const dayFiveQ_4 = '4.“Finalize writing verses 2 and 3 today.”';
  static const dayFiveQ_5 =
      '5.“Why did we consider inserting a subplot into the song? This is not mandatory, but if we do not want to be overly simple, we can have a second thing going on here… unless that is the point of your song, of course, and then by all means - stay simple and go with it! That’s cool, too.”';
  static const dayFiveQ_6 =
      '6.Well, we need to create our bridge today on day 5. This is hard, but let’s do this! The bridge should be “what the song is about.”';

  static const daySixQ_1 =

      '4.“After today, you will be taking all your rough draft ideas into account. We will guide you and help you bring this song to your guitar to practice and record it on GarageBand.
